# HackRice 12 Safety and Security Track

## Track Description
Traveling to new places can be scary! You never know what is about to happen next and the obstacles you may have to overcome. Questions like “Is this area safe?” or “Why do I hear sirens next to me?” run quickly through your mind. We need solutions to keep us safe and at ease.

Now on the flip side, our digital footprint needs to be extremely secure, too. Cybersecurity is one of the hottest fields these days with people, schools, and companies moving everything to the cloud (there’s even talk about our whole life being digital in the metaverse!). Sometimes this data can be critical—think of patient health data or unreleased company patents. We don’t want this data getting in the wrong hands!


## Prompt
Create a hack that makes people’s lives safer or strengthens our defenses against digital attacks.
